                <p>
                    The NEFFEX story might be the only thing more unique than the Southern California
                    duo’s genre-shattering music. In 2016 the pair of lifelong friends—Bryce Savage
                    [vocals] and Cameron Wales [guitar, DJ]—decided to release an original song every
                    Wednesday at 9am for 100 weeks. Using their own innovative twists and D.I.Y. spirit,
                    they went even further and shared their music, royalty-free, with hundreds of YouTube
                    channels, influencers, and blogs. Their songs exploded in popularity and, by 2018,
                    they had unleashed over 110 originals, plus remixes, that blended the sonic worlds
                    of guitar-driven pop, alternative, electronic and hip-hop. These tracks self-produced,
                    self-mixed/mastered and self-written have amounted to a billion streams & still growing
                    by 60+ million monthly.

                    NEFFEX is an independent production duo consisting of vocalist Brandon “B-Ho”
                    Horth and DJ Cam Wales. They describe their music as “an aggressive, but ultimately
                    pop-oriented blend of Hip Hop, Alternative Rock and EDM”. Their lyrics focus on sharing
                    experiences and motivating people to chase after their dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Horth and Wales started making music with a Punk Rock band at the age of 15 and later
                    formed NEFFEX in 2015. In February 2017 they started to release one song every week and
                    all of them are available for free through their SoundCloud page, though you can still
                    purchase them on other music platforms. Additionally, every song is copyright free, which
                    means that everyone can use them in YouTube videos or other works with no licensing fees.

                <p>
                    Fight Back: The Collection is the first compilation album by the duo NEFFEX, featuring
                    ten of the biggest and most motivational songs they created until the release of the
                    compilation, plus two songs that were unreleased before. It also marks their first
                    record with several tracks in general, having only published singles before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collection was announced at November 23, 2018, one week before the release. As
                    an addition to the album, special bundles were available in their merch-shop, making
                    it possible to get a physical copy of the collection, in combination with various other
                    items, like t-shirts or gym bags. The singles that were chosen for the compilation
                    have originally been released over the course of 2017 to 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name of the collection comes from the single “Fight Back”, which has been their
                    most successful song to that date. The theme of the “Fight Back”, not giving up and
                    fighting for your goals – an often used theme in NEFFEX’s songs – leads the theme
                    for the whole collection, having the goal to motivate the listener and help them
                    reach their dreams.
